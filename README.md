# Add Product Form

## Live website at https://algidpenguin.github.io/CPW203-FormWithCustomClass/

This project will have more practice with TypeScript, validation, and introduce custom classes.


This will also use CSS to style the web page to make sure it looks decently presentable as well as 
have it be responsive to screen size.
